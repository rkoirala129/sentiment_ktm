0,"Published at : March 4, 2022 ","As the Ukraine crisis lingers on, with Russia showing little sign of retreating from its military misadventures against its neighbour, Nepal has made its stance clear, condemning one nation's atrocities against another sovereign nation. The Nepal government was quick to call for restraint from all sides immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine. Nepal was one of the 29 nations that voted in favour of Ukraine's call at the UN Human Rights Council for an urgent debate on the Ukraine crisis and to condemn Russia's military overtures. Nepal was also one of the 141 members who voted in favour of the UN resolution to deplore the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Nepal's prompt response and unequivocal position against a powerful, friendly nation's unjustified action against a relatively weaker nation deserves commendation.However, the same alacrity Nepal has exhibited in making public statements on the crisis is absent when it comes to making arrangements for rescuing and rehabilitating Nepali citizens from Ukraine. Mobile images of Nepalis fleeing the war torn country or pleading for help have been doing the rounds for more than a week now, and there is no reiterating the fact that our compatriots are in danger of losing their lives and livelihoods as Russia continues to rain missiles on residential areas. Over 800,000 people have already left Ukraine, and 227 civilians have been killed and 525 injured since the attacks began on February 24. It is a full-blown humanitarian crisis, and Nepal cannot depend on Ukraine to take care of the Nepalis living there in these difficult times. We are already pretty late in initiating an evacuation operation. The government is learnt to have reached out to the Indian government through the embassy in Delhi, seeking the southern neighbour's help in evacuating Nepalis stranded in Ukraine. As per reports, the Indian government has responded positively to Nepal's request and is expected to evacuate Nepalis who have been taking refuge in Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Poland. India's gestures towards Nepalis in helping them return home, be it from Afghanistan in August last year or Ukraine now, strengthens the long-standing friendly relationship between the two South Asian nations. Nepal, meanwhile, continues to remain firm in its wait-and-watch position as it has little confidence in its capabilities than to seek the help of others even when its citizens are stranded in conflict zones.It is during times of crises that citizens feel the need to return to the safety of their homes. India's action to evacuate its citizens stranded due to the Ukraine crisis has been welcomed at home, although it faced criticism for a delayed evacuation operation. As of now, India has evacuated more than 6,000 citizens, and has reported that it has evacuated all its citizens from the capital Kyiv. What's more, it has opened an embassy in Lviv, which will allow it to evacuate more of its citizens from Ukraine into neighbouring Eastern European countries.While being grateful to India for its support to Nepal in the Ukraine crisis, it is also time to consider how the South Asian giant has disappointed the democratic world by abstaining from voting in favour of Ukraine. Sharing borders with a multitude of South Asian and Southeast Asian nations, India is at a confluence, even clash, of civilisations. Its own relationship with two of its neighbours, China and Pakistan, remains pretty strained. For a country that seeks the help of other nations when it is itself in crisis, it is disappointing that it cannot make an independent stand when a powerful nation is bullying a weaker one.  "
1,"Published at : March 2, 2022 ","Amid all the repulsive news of political mudslinging in the recent past leading up to the ratification of the Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact, a news story in the Post's Wednesday edition concerning Nepal's effort in closing the gender gap made for a pleasant read. According to a World Bank report, Nepal made the fastest progress among South Asian countries in closing gender-based gaps. Of the eight indicators, it is commendable that Nepal was able to score the maximum points—100—in laws, about the workplace, pay and marriage.The presence of fair laws is to be seen positively; however, the implementation of these all-encompassing pieces of legislation requires a robust monitoring system to provide a justifiable working environment, especially in the informal sector. At the same time, some form of adherence to the law can be attributed to the formal sector. Most people who work in the formal sector are generally aware of what the law entails, and more importantly, they have recourse to justice if they sense any form of discrimination. Therefore, it is the informal sector that we need to carefully monitor to measure the depth of the law's penetration, and only then can we fairly attribute these scores correctly.In Nepal, of the total employed population of 7.1 million people, 84.6 percent (roughly 6 million) are involved in informal employment. And with an overwhelming 90.5 percent of women engaged in the informal sector, there is more reason to ensure that the law works on a practical level for those who need it most. Both men and women put in the same amount of effort in their work, and yet women are paid far less for their effort, commonly falling victim to traditional gender perceptions that have been ingrained deep into our consciousness.Despite the informal sector contributing almost 40 percent to Nepal's gross domestic product, laws to ensure their protection against discrimination, health and general well-being are virtually non-existent. And because the informal sector primarily employs a significant percentage of women, the picture painted by the statistics do not cover the ground reality. Lack of education and rigid societal values are the foremost contributing factors that push women into the informal sector and prevent them from exploring other possibilities.Multiple issues need to be addressed in the formal sector as well. For example, laws pertaining to breastfeeding at the workplace exist, but very few places have implemented them in practice. And in another instance, statistics obtained from Nepal Rastra Bank show that 80,061 women entrepreneurs borrowed Rs73.85 billion in concessional loans provided to encourage women's participation in entrepreneurship in the first six months of the fiscal year. Still, a World Bank report published in 2020 states that businesses are registered in women's names to obtain subsidised loans, but in reality, they are run by men. There are glaring disparities between what we see on paper and the ground reality. Hence, efforts need to be undertaken to ensure that these discrepancies are plugged to have a more accurate view.  "
2,"Published at : March 1, 2022 ","The Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released on Monday, has unequivocally stated that the ground beneath our feet is shifting quickly, and that even if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we are doomed to witness a slew of climate change-induced disasters. The report has said that human-induced climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people. It has also revealed that some impacts of the rise in climate and weather extremes are irreversible, for natural and human systems are pushed beyond their ability to adapt. What is alarming is that these impacts are happening not in the distant future, but in the next two decades.“The world faces unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades with global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius,"" the report warns. ""Even temporarily exceeding this warming level will result in additional severe impacts, some of which will be irreversible. Risks for society will increase, including to infrastructure and low-lying coastal settlements.” The impact, the report has stated clearly, is going to be colossal, with over 3.5 billion people—over 45 percent of the global population—living in areas vulnerable to climate change as multiple climate hazards occur simultaneously, and multiple climatic and non-climatic risks interact.Needless to say, Nepal is highly vulnerable to climate change, as is evident in the fact that highlands are fast becoming new hubs of vector-borne diseases, with the rise of viruses like dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis. As per the report, Nepal is projected to see a 50 percent increase in damage to areas under paddy cultivation, and a substantial increase in glacial retreat. It is all too clear that the assessments we made about climate change 20 years ago are fast turning obsolete as the impacts are happening much faster and at a greater magnitude today than expected. The adaptation actions, however, have not kept up with the pace and magnitude of the climate change impacts. The report has stated that it is no longer possible to stay calm by making marginal, reactive or incremental changes; in addition to technological and economic changes, there is a need to radically transform the way we understand climate adaptation and resilience. A major precondition for climate risk reduction and adaptation is that the world must come together to fight for a shared future. But is the world listening?As of today, our priorities lie elsewhere, as is evident in the way much of the world is now engrossed by Russia's war with Ukraine. If unrestrained industrialisation and greed for capital accumulation were not enough, the spectre of a protracted conflict threatens to take away whatever little is being done towards keeping climate change in check and reducing vulnerability of humans and natural systems. While the developed world continues to pay lip service when it comes to taking responsibility for its contribution to climate change and making efforts to reduce its impact, the developing world, not one to be left behind, is fast making the same mistakes that the former did in the past. Our opportunities to undo the harm we have done to the planet and to ourselves are fast slipping away; if we continue to disregard the warnings that are in our face, we must begin to question our cognitive capabilities altogether.  "
3,"Published at : February 28, 2022 ","When Parliament ratified the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact on Sunday, February 27. The US too welcomed the ratification which could be a sign of approval of the Compact. It brought to an end a year of political squabbling in one fell swoop, albeit some were left with a sour taste in their mouth. It has been nearly five years since the MCC signed the $500 million Compact with the government of Nepal with a view to funding the upkeep of roads and building transmission lines that would be instrumental primarily in facilitating cross-border electricity trade with India. Never has there been more controversy surrounding aid which even threatened Nepal-United States relations when US Assistant Secretary of State Donald Lu said that Washington would review its relationship with Nepal in the event of its failure to ratify the Compact by February 28 deadline. So much for delaying the ratification of aid! There wasn’t much controversy, to begin with until David J Ranz, assistant secretary for South Asia at the US State Department, stated during his visit to Nepal that the MCC was a crucial part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. This was enough ammunition for dissenting leaders. And despite what US officials were saying, politicians in Nepal had opposing views, which allowed factions to be created, and people were polarised right down the middle.It took the dismantling of a government with a comfortable majority and the installation of a coalition with primarily two parties, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the CPN (Unified Socialist) who seemed to be steadfast in their opposition to the Compact in its current form. But that changed quite dramatically on the day of the ratification. While it was expected that they would oppose the Compact, the leaders of the Maoist Centre, Unified Socialist and Janata Samajbadi Party quietly agreed to vote in its favour with an “interpretative declaration” bringing years of deliberation to an end. All that frantic running around and the hustle and bustle of busybodies, in the end, amounted to nothing more than a whimper.With the impasse now overcome, we should sincerely look to put the Compact to good use. Those in opposition should join in to hold the government accountable for their tasks rather than brooding over what can’t be undone. Since Nepal has the natural resource to generate clean energy, we should capitalise on this opportunity to invest in developing infrastructure that will facilitate the export of electricity to a power-hungry India grappling with its energy crisis. It would result in a win-win situation for both countries.On the other hand, the authorities in Nepal should be serious about improving the country’s economic strength and stop being forever reliant on aid. Aid cannot be used as a pretext for development. Unearned money has never propelled a person to prosperity, which applies equally to a country. We need policies that will enable exports, generate jobs in our country and stop the unnecessary exodus of our youth. At the same time, remittance money has been a boon in eradicating poverty and replenishing our foreign exchange reserves. The administration now needs to ensure that Nepal is more than capable of generating economic returns from the export of energy and other exports.  "
4,"Published at : February 27, 2022 ","Nepal’s existence has been attributed to its fine balancing act between the two regional powers, India and China. The Himalayan republic has been going through a tremendous political upheaval of late. Change is always tumultuous, and Nepal has been undergoing political change for the last 30 years, from an absolute monarchy to multi-party democracy and now to a federalist structure. But the past few years of experimenting with federalism has, without doubt, come with their share of criticism. While some have outrightly dismissed the new system as being unfeasible, others have taken a more accommodative stance, allowing for time. After all, it has been all but five years since the promulgation of the new constitution.But the leaders haven’t been seen to operate at the same level of integrity and honesty as expected of them. Instead of focusing on development issues, the politicians have squandered the first five years in squabbling among themselves, fighting over lucrative ministerial berths, and toppling stable governments to accommodate their vested interests. What is becoming clear is that Nepal never lacked a model of governance; what it lacks is selfless visionary leaders that are ready to steer the country through the geopolitical challenges of the 21st century.Sandwiched between opposing regional powers, the need for Nepal’s leaders to dexterously balance relationships with the rival neighbours will be of utmost importance. And if our leaders are not careful enough, there are other rival powerhouses actively vying to make Nepal an unwitting pawn in the grand game of geopolitical chess. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine should be an eye-opener for the authorities in Nepal, too; the consequences of a miscalculated move in balancing national interest with those dictated by other powers will indisputably be borne by the hapless citizens as we see happening in the former Soviet republic.Because the rival superpowers would never risk jeopardising their interests and stability, however bitter they appear to be on the surface, sacrificing the pawn has always been seen as demonstrative of astute political acumen, and therefore it is upon us not to become the sacrificial lamb. Leaders need to thoroughly and carefully consider the implication of any agreement, whether the MCC or any other project deals in the pipeline. Isn’t it ironic that a parliament that has been prorogued for usual business is suddenly seen active for the ratification of ‘aid’? And if this precedence continues, we may see all the powers seeking to ratify agreements through the Parliament which could impinge on our sovereignty. The consequences of agreements endorsed without careful consideration will inevitably come back to haunt the state, perhaps in the not-so-distant future. The need of the hour is to focus our resources on building a robust Nepal. The demonstration of a robust foreign policy is only possible against a backdrop of sound economic fundamentals. There is nothing to boast of unless we uplift the living standards of every citizen, and it definitely cannot come from reliance on aid, grants or donations. Now more than ever, it has become increasingly important for politicians to get their act together and focus on policies that should ensure political and economic stability. The people have long become increasingly tired of their silly antics. "
5,"Published at : February 24, 2022 ","After months of speculation as to whether the Russian threat of a war against Ukraine would materialize, Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a televised address on Thursday approved a ""special military operation"" against Ukraine. Russian troops have now invaded Ukraine, launching an all-out war by sea, air and land. What had remained a nightmare of the Ukrainians and the rest of the world has now turned into a reality as Russia escalated unilateral aggression against a country that has clearly tried to avert any hostilities. With Russian troops attacking the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and several other cities, including Kharkiv, Kramatorsk, Dnipro, Mariupol, Odesa, and Zaporizhzhya, Europe is now witnessing the biggest attack by one state against another on the continent since World War II.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declared martial law and appealed to world leaders to castigate Russia. Zelensky on Thursday asked his citizens to remain calm but be ready to fight even as his country had suffered ""serious losses"" in the invasion, with at least 40 people being killed. As per reports, a third of the Ukrainians are ready to take up arms against Russia, and in case of retaliation by Ukraine, the hostilities could turn into a full-scale war, with the number of casualties soaring in the days to come. Initial reports about the escalation, with Russian troops targeting multiple cities, show the extent of the large-scale offensive Putin is making. As per reports, Putin's troops attacked Ukraine from Belarus and Russia, and also from annexed Crimea. The escalation is going to break the peace not only in the European region but across the world.There is no reiterating the fact that a war is never a solution to any dispute. As Albert Einstein has said in his essay ""Weapons of mass destruction"", the desire for war among nations has ""inflicted indescribable suffering and destruction upon mankind; again and again it has depraved the development of men, their souls and their well-being"". No war against another state, especially if it is a weaker one, is justified, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine is no exception. Having experienced two great wars and a long period of Cold War, powerful states of the world know the economic and human costs of war.Putin's bloodlust in Ukraine goes against the foundational principles of a modern society. As a leader leading the most populous and powerful country in the region, Putin is more responsible than others to maintain peace. However, he is doing exactly the opposite. By attacking Ukraine, Putin, whose dictatorial tendency in his home country is well known, has shown to the world once again that he is a bully in the neighbourhood, hungry for the blood of innocent people. Global leaders should find effective ways to pressurise the bully into de-escalating immediately. Warmongers of any country in the world deserve to be isolated and pushed to the corner. The only way forward is peaceful co-existence of states, leaving the detestable lust for wars and conflicts to the dingy quarters of world history. "
6,"Published at : February 23, 2022 ","When Nepal's central bank conducted a survey on inflation, the results didn't cause any flutter amongst officials, economists or the people in general—primarily because the perception of inflation isn't just based on some whim, a steady increase in fuel prices across the nation has directly affected the cost of consumables. In the last eight months, the price of gasoline has increased by more than 15 percent. This has a direct impact on freight costs, and the resultant rise in prices has been reflected in kitchen staples.People's expectations play a significant role in affecting market forces, and eventually, prices. Since Nepal relies heavily on imports, the impact of global inflationary pressure is factored into local decisions. Because we rely so heavily on imports, we in Nepal can do nothing other than bear the brunt of the consequences outside our control. Oil prices that had slumped at the start of the pandemic due to lower demand have since rocketed, and oil supplies are seen to be further disrupted by the ongoing Ukraine crisis.The other crucial reason for the increase in prices of imports is the hike in shipping and air freight costs. Shipping companies have been overwhelmed by a surge in demand after the pandemic, and Nepal, with its geographical constraints and limited port access, has no cheaper way to source its requirements. Retailers will pass on the excess cost to the ultimate consumers with no other recourse. But alarmingly, policymakers in Nepal have done nothing much to contain inflation, which is primarily import driven. The central bank's measure to control inflation by tweaking the interest rate may be a tried and tested formula, but we need to urgently adjust our import policy.Our intention to recalibrate import policy shouldn't just contain the current spiralling costs problem. It is also about propping up the agricultural sector, which we could run successfully. Due to years of neglect and faulty policies, we have systematically managed to destroy the livelihood of our farmers. While home-grown produce has been left to rot, trucks laden with fruits and vegetables, mainly from India, have unfettered access to our markets, thus pushing our farmers further into debt without much help from the government. It is ironic that a country touted as an agricultural country ended up importing Rs325 billion worth of agricultural produce in the last fiscal year which ended on July 15, 2021. Balancing our imports would also stem the depletion of our foreign exchange reserves. Nepal's total import bill reached close to a staggering Rs1 trillion just six months into the current fiscal year. Perhaps the pandemic is receding, and the job markets will pick up again to their pre-pandemic fervour allowing for replenishment of our depleted foreign exchange reserves. But surely the current import policy needs to be overhauled to suit our needs. And while we expect market prices to increase for the next few months, let's hope that we have the forbearance to put up with it. "
7,"Published at : February 22, 2022 ","That Nepal is an agricultural country sounds like a jest rather than a fact considering how we have increasingly become dependent on imported food for the past several decades. In the last two decades alone, the food import bill jumped 78 times to nearly $1 billion as Nepalis increasingly choose the easier route of splurging hard-earned money on imported food rather than growing it at home. Battered by the coronavirus pandemic, Nepal imported Rs112.59 billion worth of food from India alone in the year 2020-21, a 39 percent year-on-year increase, a large portion of the money going for the import of rice in a country obsessed with bhaat. If anything, we are staring at a food crisis of a monumental scale in the days to come.And yet, little is done towards stemming the downward spiral of the country's agricultural prowess. Chemical fertiliser is a major element that exposes the discrepancy between the claim of being an agricultural country and the failure to protect the interests of the farmers. Each year, ministers and top government officials promise to supply enough fertilisers on time. And each year, when it is time to keep the promise, they crib about one problem or another that had led to the shortage, as if finding excuses about the lack of fertilisers right before the crop season is a ritual that has to be preserved and enacted each year.As if to honour that annual ritual, Agriculture Minister Mahindra Ray Yadav on Monday lamented about the perennial nature of the fertiliser problem, blaming global rise in prices for this year's scarcity. The minister was not entirely wrong in blaming the global scenario, but little has been done to build warehouses and keep buffer stocks to ensure efficient and cheaper delivery of the plant nutrients in times of shortage and inflation. The minister also blamed the lengthy public procurement process for the inability to procure the required fertilisers in time. He was not wrong on this front too, as the procurement through the existing Public Procurement Act often takes six months for the procurement process to materialise, but he had no clues about expediting the process. At the meeting, the minister did not fail to promise a chemical fertiliser plant as a panacea although the idea of such a plant in a country that cannot ensure timely procurement of even 500,000 tonnes of the nutrients, those in the know say, is bombastic. As the timely import of enough fertilisers remains a far cry, the minister's bogus promises represent the callousness with which those at the top function, remaining clueless about a remedy even though the problem is already at the door and everyone saw it coming. Ultimately, it is the same old story of promises not kept, lessons not learnt, and actions not taken in time. The fertiliser problem exposes the lack of accountability among those who govern us, but that should change immediately to avert a crisis looming large.  "
8,"Published at : February 21, 2022 ","The promotion of Sita Pariyar to the position of chief district officer of Humla is a cause for celebration; but the first woman from the Dalit community to hold this high office also reflects poorly on what we as a society have been able to achieve in terms of social emancipation. The practice of the caste system has left such an indelible mark on the psyche of multiple generations that even after nearly 60 years since the amendment to the old civic code which outlawed discrimination based on caste, untouchability and social inequity remains rife in our society. Sadly, it is indicative of how a legal amendment means nothing unless the willingness to change comes from the core of society eager to cast off the oppressive yoke. It may be an unfamiliar experience for many, but the burden of discrimination isn’t just about extreme forms of ostracism. It is the constant denial of the fundamental right to equality, the right against exploitation, and the right to live with dignity on a daily basis. Such is the state of abuse that society in the 21st century needs special laws drafted to protect their brethren. Caste-based discrimination is not just a blemish; it is an abomination of our society.What people seek is to be treated fairly and equally. If there is a sense of fairness in society, then the opportunities present will fall on to those who work to achieve it. But because there is widespread discrimination, it becomes the prerogative of the state to intervene and ensure that no section of society gets left behind. For instance, according to a National Human Rights Commission report, the representation of the Dalit community in the state apparatus is abysmal, for lack of a better term.Of the 88,578 people serving in the civil service today, only 1,971 are from the Dalit community, just about 2.2 percent, and about 9.45 percent representation in the Nepal Police, 8.14 percent in the Nepal Army, and the lowest of them all, just 1 percent in the judiciary. This low representation is primarily due to the widespread discriminatory environment that the people of the Dalit community endure for most of their lives. The state guarantees admission to school, but what is lacking is an environment where there is no social discrimination.And hence, only a few of them solely determined to turn their lives around amid all odds manage to swim to the top, while the multitudes lose their shine and drop out fatigued by societal ostracism. It is poignant to point out that discrimination exists not just in the rural hinterlands but is, in fact, quite alive and kicking in the cities too. There have been many instances of people being denied accommodation after being found to belong to the Dalit community. If we are to ever progress as a society, then there is even more reason to shun such bigoted practices, but rather cultivate the necessity to show just a little compassion instead of hatred.  "
9,"Published at : February 20, 2022 ","Instead of focusing on conducting the local and general elections, the country is wallowing in the MCC fiasco. It is natural for politicians in other nations to aggressively tackle endemic problems centred on the economy, social welfare, health and education. But these are issues rarely discussed in the election manifestos. The elections of 2017 resulted in one of the strongest mandates accorded to a political party since the reinstatement of democracy in 1991. Forging an alliance between KP Sharma Oli’s CPN-UML and Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s Maoist Centre seemed an uphill task, and many were still sceptical of their election success. But the results put all doubts to rest.And despite a landslide victory, secure in numbers, the fickleness amongst the politicians was evident from the start. Instead of focusing on the people’s problems, they fought over ministries and lucrative berths. Unable to satiate their egos, they decided that the interest of the nation would be better served only if their vested interests were secure. Constant bickering eventually led to the fall of a government supposedly built on an unshakable foundation guaranteed by the most decisive mandate in the last 30 years.And yet no apology was rendered for the betrayal of the mandate given to them, nor have we seen any form of expression of regret for their disastrous track record so far. The severe difficulties people faced from the successive waves of the pandemic have been all but forgotten. The cash schemes promised by the government for the multitudes of daily wagers have failed to materialise, yet no concrete steps have been taken to bridge the gap in policies. Despite hardships, the affected people have stayed away from those grants due to rigorous criteria. Instead of clearing hurdles to facilitate services, the authorities are mainly seen to operate without concern; their duty has been fulfilled by simply announcing the schemes. The successful completion of a task ensures that the objectives set out are met. The responsibility of the government doesn’t end with the announcement of plans. If there is poor response to the schemes, perhaps the authorities need to delve deeper to understand the reason behind the lacklustre reaction from the public. Absconding from responsibilities does not end the plight of those who have to rough it out day in and day out without any respite.There is no end to foolish talk from the politicians when it comes to promises. The people have been promised everything from operating ships to facilitating the movement of goods to tunnelling through hills to bring in trains, to connect Nepal with China and the world better. Yet the people are left to grapple with basic necessities. Where is the fabled Melamchi Water Project? Why do the politicians never seem to discuss the burgeoning trade deficit? How do the authorities intend to tackle the on-going inflation? Instead of making delusional promises, how about operating at a rational level for once? "
10,"Published at : February 17, 2022 ","That the five-party coalition government formed after the ignominious ouster of the KP Sharma Oli administration had a short life span was no guesswork. The Oli administration had already expended 3.5 years even as it slowly lost steam midway. As Oli's political manoeuvres against democratic politics got worse each passing month, his government finally imploded after he dissolved the House first in December 2020 and again in May 2021. So, when Sher Bahadur Deuba came to power with the backing of Oli's former comrades—Pushpa Kamal Dahal of the Maoist Centre and Madhav Kumar Nepal of the CPN (Unified Socialist)—Deuba was expected to buttress the democratic process and work hard to ease the lives of Nepalis battered by the coronavirus pandemic. Seven months into power, the Deuba government is a house of cards.What is different this time is that the government is on the verge of an implosion, neither due to the callous political decisions that Deuba is known for, nor due to greed for power that most Nepali political parties and leaders are known for. The thorn in the flesh this time is the Millennium Challenge Corporation compact (MCC) that has got the coalition partners bickering. When it came to power, its stated claim was to embolden Nepal's parliamentary democracy and not to argue about an international grant project. Its common minimum programme shied away from mentioning the MCC, prompting the then recently ousted prime minister KP Sharma Oli to question the Deuba government's commitment to the compact. However, as Deuba makes its ratification the unequivocal agenda of his government, the coalition has now come to an impasse.On Wednesday, Deuba backtracked from his plan to table the MCC compact amid the Maoist Centre's strong disagreement and a threat to break the coalition. However, Prime Minister Deuba is reported to have decided to move ahead with the tabling of the compact in Parliament on Friday even as the Maoist Centre stands firm on its threat that it would withdraw from the government if an effort to ratify it is made. The Maoist Centre is emboldened in its claim by the support of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which has expressed strong opposition to the compact since the beginning. And in so doing, the party, which has changed multiple partners effortlessly in making and breaking governments in just a decade and a half of its life in democratic politics, is following a pattern that is quite familiar with those who have watched Nepal's democratic politics evolve in the past three decades. The Maoist Centre is not particularly known to stick with its coalition partners. After all, Dahal, the party chief, has on more than one occasion hinted that he does not believe in keeping permanent friends and enemies, which he terms as part of the political game. And, as the elections come near, there is the voter base to placate notwithstanding the fact that the party chief has signed a letter expressing firm commitment to get the compact ratified through a consensus. And that is the degenerative Nepali politics at its wicked best. From the outside, Nepali politics has certainly gone through a sea change in the past three decades, more specifically after the 2006 democratic movement. However, the one thing that has remained constant and given Nepali politics a distinctive flavour is the making and breaking of governments for petty reasons. It is one thing to debate vociferously on the merits and demerits of a foreign aid grant, but the possibility of a government formed to ""save democracy"" being on the verge of an implosion due to differences over the funding is uncalled for. "
11,"Published at : February 16, 2022 ","When the video of a current serving minister spewing expletives went viral a few days ago, it could be said that it reflects the degenerative direction of the nation’s politics. For it seems to be attracting people with the worst etiquette. It wasn’t a slip of the tongue or a gaffe; it was impropriety at its finest. It was clear that such expletives were unbecoming of a person holding the rank of a minister, but not quite surprising for it seems that politics in Nepal has been attracting people from those quarters devoid of any form of modesty, in word or deed. But degenerative politics isn’t just about Prem Bahadur Ale, minister of culture, tourism and civil aviation, and it’s ironic that the word “culture” is latched on to the designation he holds. It isn’t the first time he has courted controversy—there was no modesty either when he decided to paste pictures of himself on the oxygen cylinders dispatched to various hospitals during the height of the pandemic. Politics, in general, seems to have gone downhill right around the world, but more so in Nepal and the subcontinent. A person can do and say just about anything and get away with it. There isn’t much thought given to what is being said—it is us, the people, who have failed to hold them accountable for what is said and done. Hollow words are bandied about without any fear of repercussion, and since accountability is non-existent, the politicians in Nepal are well aware that their actions will go unchallenged.It is unthinkable for even the slightest inference to expletives to be tolerated in the private sector. It would also be ridiculous for a convicted criminal to pursue jobs in the private sector. A gap in the curriculum vitae is often questioned with utmost scrutiny before a candidate is invited for an interview, let alone offered a job. But in stark contrast, we have allowed persons with criminal track records and those of questionable reputation to hold high political office without anyone batting an eyelid. If it is natural to think that maintaining high standards in private recruitment isn’t out of the ordinary. What stops us from adopting those standards for those who seek to stand for public office?Adoption of democracy isn’t just about seeking votes and being elected to public office but upholding the reverence of the position one occupies. For these reasons, perhaps Plato was able to use the metaphor of a ship to highlight the concerns of electing unfit people to the highest office representing their people and the state. And with the way things are going, for the last few years, we have witnessed our politicians’ absolute disregard for the rule of law; they have blatantly exposed their inability to rule. Politics has been reduced to a mere tool for achieving their ambitions and goals. While another election year nears, undoubtedly, the majority of us will once again fall victim to their deceptive acts and promises.  "
12,"Published at : February 15, 2022 ","here isn’t much that is particularly commendable about Nepal’s vaccination drive against the Covid-19 pandemic. More than a year after the state began inoculating its citizens, only 54 percent of the population has been fully vaccinated. If the initial phase of the vaccination drive faced hiccups owing to the state’s inability to procure enough doses, leading to a months-long gap between the first and second doses, the past few months, when vaccine doses have become easier to procure, have laid bare the state’s logistical ineptitude exposed by its failure to administer them quickly. Logistics, though, is not the only problem undermining the state’s vaccination drive. Throughout the country, countless families are yet to be vaccinated as they lack basic information about the vaccine. As the Post reported on Tuesday, 70 Musahar families in Chandrapur Municipality in Rautahat district remain unvaccinated because they are either vaccine hesitant or live in a vaccine information void. Members of the Musahar community who spoke with the Post said they had no idea what the injection did, and where they could get it. Only 20 percent of the members of another Musahar community in Gajura Municipality were reported vaccinated in a district whose overall vaccination rate is 45 percent. Health officials and administrators point to a trend among marginalised communities, including Dalits and Adivasis, of members being left behind in the vaccination drive—a clear case of vaccine inequity in a country that is rife with divisions along the lines of caste, class, community and gender, among others. There is no overstating the fact that optimum immunity against the coronavirus is impossible to reach unless each of us is vaccinated. Vaccination, therefore, is a collective responsibility—that of the state and the citizens. But what of those who have little knowledge about the whats and whys of the vaccine? It is the state’s responsibility to ensure that those who hesitate to get jabbed or do not know about the vaccination drive altogether are addressed through a robust information campaign. The state may think it has fulfilled its responsibility by using caller ringback tones or media campaigns to invite people to get vaccinated, but that is not enough. In a country that still reels under considerable illiteracy, the state cannot just remain content with lofty ideas of media campaigning alone. There is no doubt that the media plays an effective role in disseminating information widely and quickly; however, more often than not, citizens have little time or cognitive interest to decipher the messages the media campaigns are trying to convey. Moreover, there are those who need consistent in-person explanation and counselling for them to understand what it means to get fully vaccinated against a virus. It is this information gap that the state needs to fulfil by adopting a unique, needs-based information dissemination approach. This necessitates a decentralised information dissemination apparatus that addresses each individual even in far-flung areas. One way to do this is to deploy health volunteers and local level representatives to conduct a house-to-house campaign so that citizens make the effort to visit vaccination centres for their own safety and that of others around them. It is those who have the least agency who need state support the most, the state cannot rest unless the last unvaccinated citizen gets the jab.  "

Hence, such work needs to proceed with extra caution since it requires a considerable investment of time and money. And any obstruction to the project after initiation only adds to a myriad of problems typical of a construction project. Gaurishankar Conservation Area in the country's eastern Himalayan region has issued a directive asking the Rolwaling Khola Hydroelectric Project and the Lapche Khola Hydropower Project to stop any construction immediately.The hydropower projects have been accused of flouting norms and environmental standards. It is pretty characteristic of power projects to muscle their way into achieving what they want by breaching agreed norms like Lapche Khola Hydropower, which has been accused of felling trees and constructing a road without obtaining a permit. Sure, the issue at hand concerns the provision of power much needed for the nation's development, but why cannot the project officials work in tandem with the conservation area? The blame for constructing the road has been shifted to rural municipalities, but the damage has already been done.The hills and mountainous regions in Nepal are prone to landslides, especially during the monsoon season; and projects such as these often need to level the area by moving a lot of earth, and this process leads to widespread destruction of the surrounding vegetation and wildlife. One may have thought that the environmental impact assessment (EIA) would incorporate all the thorny issues revolving around the project. But it seems that Lapche Khola Hydropower has not bothered to submit documents related to the EIA. Such irresponsible acts do nothing more than become a hindrance to the smooth functioning of projects. Constant delays only cause cost overruns at the existing projects. Hence, abiding by the agreed standards often works in favour of the concerned projects. But there will be consequences for prioritising profits over the environment. When environmental issues have hogged the limelight and have taken centre stage on global platforms, companies and projects should avoid the blemish of being reckless with the environment. The effects of non-adherence are made clear by nature itself, wreaking havoc during the monsoon rather than a slap on the wrist often accorded by the authorities for breaching the agreed standards.Nepal does not have sound credentials concerning adherence to environmental standards. Whether it is about excavating river beds for their sand or pebbles or the complete decimation of hills to extract minerals, there have always been reports of non-adherence partly because those involved in the trade know very well that the authorities can be manoeuvred as per their will. And as long as this continues, issues will be raised and quietly forgotten.  "
14,"Published at : February 13, 2022 ","When the Omicron variant of Covid-19 was first detected in South Africa, governments worldwide resorted to a series of measures in their endeavours to contain the virus. And such efforts have been familiar with every successive wave, focusing on one particular issue; protecting the health system from being completely overwhelmed. Apart from the decimation of economies, the lasting impact has been on health. Given the gravity of the crisis, the management of Covid has been of the utmost priority for the authorities. Still, this prioritisation has come at the cost of ignoring non-communicable and other infectious diseases.Whether voluntarily or induced through the series of lockdowns, deferments of medical appointments have taken a toll on people’s health. And with the resources– both financial and human—stretched to breaking point, there is little doubt that regular health programmes have been adversely affected. People engaged in vaccinating children against hepatitis B, tuberculosis or other serious ailments were re-deployed to make up for the gaps in immunising people against Covid. This drive has virtually stalled over the last two years. The implications of this crisis may not be apparent now, but sadly, the impact of these debilitating effects will be more apparent soon unless the government acts on it with immediate effect.During the first year of the ongoing pandemic, in 2020, the government decided to slash the budget for the treatment of non-communicable diseases by more than two-thirds compared to the amount allocated in 2019. Only Rs40 million was set aside compared to Rs135 million previously despite several studies showing that the risk posed by non-communicable diseases is far higher than from communicable diseases. The impact of the budget cut was undoubtedly felt most by those at the bottom of the economic pyramid. Instead of increasing the healthcare budget, the administration, in its infinite wisdom, decided that re-deploying financial resources within health care would help avoid an imminent catastrophe.According to the World Health Organisation, in 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic, non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, chronic lung disease and cancer accounted for almost 74 percent of deaths globally. Of the top 10 causes of death, seven of the leading causes of death in 2019 were non-communicable diseases. This situation has been further exacerbated, particularly in Nepal, which lacks the provisions of universal health care as most people have to rely on the services provided by private hospitals and care centres. And people often deferring medical appointments for fear of contracting the dreaded virus has intensified a silent but lethal crisis.Numerous other programmes have been affected, particularly concerning maternal health, child health and nutrition, and the less talked about mental health issues. Data shows that since the pandemic, there has been a steady rise in the number of suicide cases as well—the act considered a taboo isn’t widely discussed. Still, suicide is a significant indicator of mental health problems prevalent in Nepal. Perhaps the government’s priorities are misdirected, and if they remain complacent about the burgeoning crisis concerning other communicable and non-communicable diseases, it could be that we’re sitting on a ticking time bomb.  "
15,"Published at : February 10, 2022 ","The tragedy of human life is that we often realise the implications of our action only after the wrong has been done. That is evident most poignantly if we see how our unbridled greed for infrastructure development has led to the destruction of the world around us. The latest instance of our foolhardiness is the felling of a kapok tree in Shuklagandaki Municipality-2 as part of the expansion project of the Muglin-Pokhara section of Prithvi Highway. If the cutting of 8,000 trees along the highway was not enough, the Department of Roads failed to halt the felling of the kapok tree atop which a slender-billed vulture had built a nest and laid eggs. Desperate requests by conservationists to not chop down the tree until the eggs were hatched fell on deaf ears, although it wouldn’t be too difficult to know that the bird is an endangered bird species. It is almost always the case that a new infrastructure development project leads to a conflict between the natural environment and the built environment. Such has been the story of our flawed development paradigm that a narrow track is opened at first following old foot trails, and a few years later, the narrow track needs an expansion due to traffic congestion. And, inevitably, the old chautaris, bisaunis, patis and pauwas become a nuisance in the flawed path to development. What follows is a destruction of heritages that have remained in place for centuries as part of our society and culture. The juggernaut of unbridled development spares nothing on its way, and that is a sad reality of our times. Why is it that we, in our endless endeavour for development, design our projects in such flawed ways that we end up displacing or putting at risk the humans or other forms of life that have lived there for generations?For a country that is obsessed with development, heritages, lived memories and the lives of living organisms seem to mean absolutely nothing. For an engineer or a contractor, or a people’s representative keen to finish a road project, the nest of a vulture may mean nothing. Or a vulture’s eggs may have little value than the poultry eggs that one can purchase in the market. The very existence of an endangered bird’s nest atop a tree next to a highway may come as a nuisance to an agent of development who has little training in empathy. And that shows how, despite monumental gains in knowledge about environment, ecology and society, we remain predatory humans that seek to thrive by disregarding the lives of others. It is high time we became more thoughtful about how to coexist with ecology and environment even as we develop infrastructures for our convenience. This mad rush for development ultimately leads to the making of a world full of concrete structures that push to obliterate our stories, memories and histories. Could we not exist alongside one another without turning predators? Yes we can. But what we need is a radical rethinking of the very idea of infrastructure development, where non-interference with the natural world is non-negotiable. "
16,"Published at : February 9, 2022 ","If there is one thing that has remained a casualty in the petty politics of political parties, it is the House of Representatives. On Tuesday, a Business Advisory Committee meeting to finalise the list of tentative agenda items was adjourned at the eleventh hour, pushing the next meeting of the House to February 14. This, just over a week after Speaker Agni Sapkota on January 30 postponed the House meeting by 10 days citing the threat of the coronavirus pandemic although, as the Post reported quoting Parliament Secretariat officials, it was the differences among the parties on tabling the Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact Nepal (MCC) that had prompted him to put off the meeting.On this particular front, the speaker has faced backlash from several quarters as his seemingly active role in deciding whether the motion on MCC gets tabled in Parliament is called unusual and unbecoming of a non-partisan position holder. It is all too clear by now that he is keen to keep the matter of MCC in limbo unless he gets the green signal from the Maoist Centre, the party he belonged to before he became the speaker. As he continues to impede the functioning of Parliament, questions arise as to whether Sapkota is really committed to the democratic process that he moderates as the speaker. However, Speaker Sapkota is hardly the only person impeding the function of Parliament. The CPN-UML has been the vanguard in obstructing Parliament for over five months now, primarily due to its differences with Sapkota. What is unexplainable in this months-long fiasco is that unlike in a normal parliamentary setup where the opposition party obstructs Parliament to oppose the government, the UML is obstructing it to settle scores with the speaker. The bone of contention in this case is the speaker’s failure to issue a notice related to the UML’s expulsion of its 14 lawmakers from the then Madhav Kumar Nepal camp who eventually went on to form the CPN (Unified Socialist).So blinded is the UML in its enmity with Sapkota that it has expressed its willingness to get the MCC Compact ratified in Parliament if he could somehow be ousted from his position. That is petty politics at its best. In any case, the UML is not particularly known for its commitment to letting Parliament do its business in a democratic manner. In 2001, the party, under Madhav Kumar Nepal, obstructed Parliament for 57 days seeking resignation of the then prime minister Girija Prasad Koirala over the Lauda Air scam. Even as Madhav has exited the party and has joined a coalition that forms the current government, the UML continues with its legacy of obstructing Parliament for months. Only this time, the UML is close to doubling its previous record as it shows no sign of relenting.The government, meanwhile, remains incapable of breaking the stalemate as it is torn between saving the coalition and saving face in front of the donor community. This limbo does not represent the democratic politics the people envisioned for Nepal. Parliament cannot continue to remain the centre of disorder created by petty politics even as heated debates form the bedrock of parliamentary democracy.  "
17,"Published at : February 8, 2022 ","The exchange of secret correspondence between the incumbent prime minister and the chairman of the Maoist Centre with the chairman of the Millennium Challenge Corporation shows absolute ineptness on the part of our politicians in governing forthrightly. These covert actions do not seem in any way to represent the interest of the nation and are a blot on democratic governance. The leaking of the correspondence not just exposes the politicians’ duplicity but also their fondness for carrying out such secretive dealings. On the one hand, they are always colluding among themselves to achieve their vested political interests, and on the other, their intention is to hoodwink the public to achieve those aims. The manner in which politicians have been operating shows complete non-compliance with acceptable norms and governance standards. For instance, KP Sharma Oli, the then prime minister, promptly rolled out the red carpet for the Indian intelligence chief Samant Goel who came to Nepal to pay a “courtesy call”. And this meeting was so secretive that even after all these months, nothing has been ascertained concerning the details of the meeting. If a one-on-one meeting between the head of a foreign intelligence agency and the prime minister of another sovereign nation doesn’t ring alarm bells, then what does? Isn’t it the prerogative of the administration to come clean with the facts concerning the meeting?What has happened is not an anomaly though; in the past too, politicians have resorted to such tête-à-tête, but the failure of Nepali politicians to maintain the minimum decorum while dealing with friendly nations not only tarnishes Nepal’s credentials but also erodes the faith of the people who voted them to power. Nefarious actions cannot be justified as acceptable governance practice; politicians need to rise above their selfish interests to meet the expectations of the people they serve in a manner that does not belittle the country’s image.Internal politics desperately needs to be redefined as well; the actions of the current coalition government could be termed nothing less than degenerative dirty politics. Immediately after taking over as prime minister, Deuba concentrated all his efforts on repealing the Political Parties Act 2017, which was a stumbling block preventing him and his political partners from grabbing power. These were measures taken by a small group of politicians to fulfil their vested interests. It wasn’t about effectively handling the ongoing pandemic or providing some relief to those who have perished during the onslaught of the pandemic. It was squarely about politics for the sake of politics and to strengthen their cause in remaining relevant.Their activities do not seem to point to the functioning of the democratic process. Democracy isn’t just about the electoral process which, in fact, they have been trying to subvert lately. It is about protecting the human rights of all citizens; it is about governing in a transparent environment. More importantly, it is about adhering to the rule of law. In this regard, politicians have failed miserably. But what is more astonishing is that they seem emboldened and unafraid of the repercussions of acting in a way that is always trying to undermine the rule of law. Politicians seem to forget that citizens are not their subjects and the country is not their fiefdom.  "
18,"Published at : February 7, 2022 ","The Central Bureau of Statistics has published various facts and figures in its census report. The figures indicate a particular cause for concern. One, there is a lopsided concentration of people in the Tarai region. Two, just over 66 percent of the population resides in urban areas. With 68 percent of the world’s population projected to live in urban areas by 2050, the figure reflected may tempt people to believe it is in line with global trends. But urbanisation is pretty shambolic in Nepal, and there are numerous problems that the administration needs to be mindful of.Towns and cities have seen unprecedented expansion in the last two decades, but it has been largely unplanned and pretty haphazard. There is no thought to preserve any natural aesthetics when building houses, and more often than not, the access ways to residential properties are ill planned. And with more and more people moving into urban areas, it has led to an acute shortage of accommodation, and consequentially sky-high rent rates have forced newcomers to live in squalid conditions. There’s nothing rosy for the early settlers either. People living in cities lack basic amenities. Access to clean, affordable drinking water is still a significant problem in the cities, especially for residents in Kathmandu. People’s expectations were dashed when the much-awaited Melamchi Water Supply Project had to stop supplying water to the valley to carry out repair works after barely being operational for a few months. Waste management is another issue where no lasting solution has been reached; often, during the monsoon season, residents of Kathmandu have to endure piles of rubbish strewn all over the city. And to make matters worse, there is the issue of raw sewage being brazenly dumped in rivers making it unbearable to even walk along the banks, let alone reside there. The inadequacies of solid waste management, if not resolved, could lead to environmental degradation and aggravate public health problems. These are just a few examples of the disorganised state of operations. The history of urban planning is a new concept to the Nepali psyche. The concept of urban planning was only introduced in the third national five-year plan 1967-71, and it is pretty evident that nothing much has been done to cater to the needs of the masses of people flocking to urban areas.Every bit of free space is being used up to erect concrete structures to accommodate the ever-increasing flow of people, often encroaching on areas deemed uninhabitable by the old locals. The disastrous effects were visible for all during the earthquake in 2015 when buildings built on loose grounds gave way and led to their collapse, causing widespread damage and destruction and loss of life. But the way urbanisation has continued, it seems the hazards of high-rises have been all but forgotten. There is an urgent need to redress the ongoing problem of continued urbanisation, and if we are to carry on at this pace, stretching every bit of resource at our disposal, we could be looking at a ticking time bomb.  "
19,"Published at : February 6, 2022 ","Almost two years since the pandemic started, the disruptions it caused in various sectors continue unabated. The start-stop regime has brought immeasurable annoyance to the masses and, more so, to students who have had to endure the pangs of receiving classes through virtual mediums. This has had a considerable impact on their performance. Still, the problem of imparting courses online isn't unique to countries that suffer from infrastructural deficiencies as opposed to those countries that seemed ready for remote working and learning. But no preparation proved enough for the psychological impact the lockdown had on people.The schools in Nepal have been intermittently shut for the most part in the last two years. The authorities have exercised due precaution to contain the virus by closing down schools. But their decision to close the schools came hastily without any measures to ensure seamless education for the multitudes studying in government schools. It wasn't just the students in remote areas of Nepal but also those in urban areas lacking the financial strength to afford laptops, tablets or even a rudimentary smartphone to continue studying. The lucky few studying in private institutions who could afford such devices did manage to continue, albeit with a few glitches along the way.There has been a glaring discrepancy in formulating and implementing policies concerning Covid-19 management right from the start. In Nepal, we always seem to be aping the policies of other nations, particularly the West. Suppose they implement the need to carry vaccine passports. In that case, the administration imposes the requirement for vaccine cards—perhaps with the intention of inducing people to get their jabs—still, even a well-intentioned measure mentioned above piled more trouble on the average person. There was no need to rush people to crowd the vaccination centres at short notice. And actions such as limiting passengers on public transport and maintaining social distancing are rarely enforced.No sooner had in-person classes resumed than they returned to the virtual medium, and parents have become increasingly worried about the impact on their children's overall knowledge. It shows how vital classroom interaction and mingling with peers is to achieve overall development. So, the critical question remains unanswered: Are students learning through virtual mediums? Or is it merely a tool to fill in idle time lest they happen to lose their way and resort to aimless loitering?The decisions to open and close schools have become a complex issue for all countries due to the ever-changing nature of the virus. And particularly for schools in urban areas of Nepal with a high concentration of students and without proper ventilation. But measures need to be taken to bridge the glaring disparity for those who do not have access to virtual learning platforms while keeping them safe from the dangers of the virus. It is a tough task for the authorities to provide a risk-free and secure environment.  "
